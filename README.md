# Personal Website

This is the repo for my personal website for hosting my projects.

It's been through several iterations throughout its lifetime,
but its become increasingly minimal, with the goal of being
easier to work with for me, and presenting content in the most 
straightforward way possible.

The current version is a collection of jade templates served 
by a small node/express server and built with gulp. It is deployed
and hosted using Zeit's [Now](https://zeit.co/now).
